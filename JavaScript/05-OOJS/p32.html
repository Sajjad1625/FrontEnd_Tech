        <h1>Static Method..!</h1>
        <p>Js provides static method that belongs to the class instead of an instance of class . These methods are called directily on the class itself.</p>
    </center>
    <hr>

    <h3>Points to remember..!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The static keyword is used to declare a static method.</li>
        <li>The static method can be any name.</li>
        <li>A class can contain more than one static method.</li>
        <li>If we declare more than one stativ method with a similar name, th JS always invokes the last one.</li>
        <li>We can use this keyword to call the static method within another static method.</li>
        <li>we can't use this keyword directily to call a static method within non-static method.</li>
        <li>In such case, we can call the static method either using the class name or as the property of the constructor</li>
    </ul>
